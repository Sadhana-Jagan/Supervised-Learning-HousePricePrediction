# Supervised-Learning-HousePricePrediction
# Linear Regression with Gradient Descent

This project implements linear regression using gradient descent in Python, specifically designed for predicting housing prices based on various features like square footage, number of bedrooms, etc. It includes functions to calculate the cost, gradient, and the z-score for feature scaling, along with a full implementation of gradient descent.
